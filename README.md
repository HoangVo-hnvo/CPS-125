# CPS-125
This repository is work that I've done during CPS-125 (Digital Computation and Programming) W2020 which is mostly an Introduction to the C Programming Language. 

CPS-125 is a Ryerson University course that was mandatory for Engineering Students during our second semester; I've taken the course in W2020. I would also like to recuse myself of any academic misconduct as the intention of this repository is to show my work, so please do not directly copy and paste. 

The IDE that I've used throughout this course would be CodeBlox and the final project was a group effort.
